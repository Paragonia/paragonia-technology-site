                <p>
                    Specialised in the design and implementation of large-scale complex systems.
                    I enjoy working with independent inter-disciplinary teams and collaborative organizations.
                    I have been working actively on the areas of business analysis, interaction design, functional modeling, enterprise architecture, technical design, and full stack software development.

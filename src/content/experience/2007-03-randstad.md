As a lead developer I was responsible for the architecture and implementation of a white label international job site. This job site provided the default option to modernize and unify international Randstad brands and was successfully adopted in multiple countries.

Our agile team delivered new functionality on a weekly basis. We used a domain driven approach. With object relational mapping we managed to implement a rich domain model while keeping database access efficient. One of the key features was job search, where users could define advanced queries and filter down using a multi-faceted search, which was very novel at the time.

Static content and layouts were maintained in a CMS and interwoven with application sections in our back-end.
